          Finding page numbers or grid reference number for a page or any
other information by using the index of a book has never been
difficult for most of us, as we all have experiences of using some
form of dictionary or another. Similarly, whatever short or long
journey we make in our day-to-day drive it has never been difficult
to go from one point to another in this age of satellite navigation. 
But planning the same route in TFL&#39;s topographical assessment is
bit tricky due to 2D Master Atlas of Greater London in
nature, where flyover or under pass, tunnel or foot over, drawing
of various road condition overlaps each other. Identifying
junctions, roundabouts, one-way or closed road and planning
most direct routes to pass a test is surely a little hazardous. But
there is everything in that book so that anyone can be confident
by carefully looking at the book and having necessary practice as
in the real test. Sometimes, just trying on your own may make you
feel bored and time-consuming. If you think you need help from a
private tutor who has better experience of understanding
topography and is enthusiastic to make other people confident
about the test in just a couple of hours, feel free to contact me.
Let me offer myself as your personal trainer for TFL&#39;s
topographical test preparation, a mandatory test of your Private
Hire Licensing program.</p>
